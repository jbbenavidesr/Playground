# Advent of code 2024

Space for solving the Advent of code challenges for the 2024 version.

## Challenges

- [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1): Historian Hysteria
- [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2): Red-Nosed Reports
- [Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/3): Mull It Over
- [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/4): Ceres Search
- [Day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/5): Print Queue

## Goal

My goal with this is to build a command line application that I can use for getting the
results of any of the challenges in the advent calendar. At the beginning I'll solve
each challenge individually and as time goes I'll start to find patterns and
similarities that allow me to modularize functionality and have a single CLI entrypoint.
